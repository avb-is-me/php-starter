## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, the "header" refers to the outermost `<div>` element with the class "header". This div represents the top section or header of a web page. It contains:

1. A logo (linked to Aparecium Labs website)
2. A navigation menu with links to "Home" and "Composer Demo"

The header is styled using Bootstrap classes for responsiveness and layout:

- It's flexible (d-flex)
- Changes layout on different screen sizes (flex-column flex-md-row)
- Aligns items (align-items-center)
- Has padding and margin (p-3 px-md-4 mb-3)
- Has a white background with a bottom border and shadow (bg-white border-bottom shadow-sm)

This structure creates a typical website header with branding and navigation elements.
