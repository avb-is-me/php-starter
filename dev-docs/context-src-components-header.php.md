## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, the "header" refers to the outermost `<div>` element with the class "header". This div represents the top section or header of a web page. Here's a concise explanation of its components:

1. It uses Bootstrap classes for responsive layout and styling.
2. Contains a logo section with an image linked to Aparecium Labs website.
3. Includes a navigation menu with links to "Home" and "Composer Demo" pages.
4. The header is designed to be flexible, adjusting its layout for different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
5. It has a white background with a bottom border and shadow for visual separation from the main content.

This header serves as the top part of the page, providing branding (logo) and navigation options for the website.
